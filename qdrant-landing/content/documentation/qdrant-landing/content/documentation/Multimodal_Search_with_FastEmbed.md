### Tutorial

Install & import **Qdrant** and **FastEmbed**

We will **FastEmbed** for generating multimodal embeddings and **Qdrant** for storing and retrieving them.

```python
!python3 -m pip install --upgrade qdrant-client fastembed Pillow
```

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models

client = QdrantClient(
    ":memory:"
)  #:memory: option is suitable only for simple prototypes/demos with Python client (!)
```

Let's embed a very short selection of images and their captions in the **shared embedding space** with CLIP.

```python
from fastembed import TextEmbedding, ImageEmbedding


documents = [
    {"caption": "A photo of a cute pig", "image": "images/piggy.jpg"},
    {"caption": "A picture with a coffee cup", "image": "images/coffee.jpg"},
    {"caption": "A photo of a colourful lizard", "image": "images/lizard.jpg"},
]

text_model_name = "Qdrant/clip-ViT-B-32-text"  # CLIP text encoder
text_model = TextEmbedding(model_name=text_model_name)
text_embeddings_size = text_model._get_model_description(text_model_name)[
    "dim"
]  # dimension of text embeddings, produced by CLIP text encoder (512)
texts_embeded = list(
    text_model.embed([document["caption"] for document in documents])
)  # embedding captions with CLIP text encoder

image_model_name = "Qdrant/clip-ViT-B-32-vision"  # CLIP image encoder
image_model = ImageEmbedding(model_name=image_model_name)
image_embeddings_size = image_model._get_model_description(image_model_name)[
    "dim"
]  # dimension of image embeddings, produced by CLIP image encoder (512)
images_embeded = list(
    image_model.embed([document["image"] for document in documents])
)  # embedding images with CLIP image encoder
```

Create a **Collection**

```python
if not client.collection_exists("text_image"):  # creating a Collection
    client.create_collection(
        collection_name="text_image",
        vectors_config={  # Named Vectors
            "image": models.VectorParams(
                size=image_embeddings_size, distance=models.Distance.COSINE
            ),
            "text": models.VectorParams(
                size=text_embeddings_size, distance=models.Distance.COSINE
            ),
        },
    )
```

Now let's upload our images with captions to the **Collection**. Each image with its caption will create a [Point](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/points/) in Qdrant.

```python
client.upload_points(
    collection_name="text_image",
    points=[
        models.PointStruct(
            id=idx,  # unique id of a point, pre-defined by user
            vector={
                "text": texts_embeded[idx],  # embeded caption
                "image": images_embeded[idx],  # embeded image
            },
            payload=doc,  # original image and its caption
        )
        for idx, doc in enumerate(documents)
    ],
)
```

Let'see what image we will get to the query "*What would make me energetic in the morning?*"

```python
from PIL import Image

find_image = text_model.embed(
    ["What would make me energetic in the morning?"]
)  # query, we embed it, so it also becomes a vector

Image.open(
    client.search(
        collection_name="text_image",  # searching in our collection
        query_vector=(
            "image",
            list(find_image)[0],
        ),  # searching only among image vectors with our textual query
        with_payload=[
            "image"
        ],  # user-readable information about search results, we are interested to see which image we will find
        limit=1,  # top-1 similar to the query result
    )[0].payload["image"]
)
```

![png](documentation/Multimodal_Search_with_FastEmbed/output_10_0.png)

Now let's do a reverse search:

Let'see what caption we will get, searching by the piglet image, which, as you can check, is not in our **Collection**:

```python
Image.open("images/piglet.jpg")  # to display what are we working with
```

![png](documentation/Multimodal_Search_with_FastEmbed/output_12_0.png)

```python
find_image = image_model.embed(["images/piglet.jpg"])  # embedding our image query

client.search(
    collection_name="text_image",
    query_vector=(
        "text",
        list(find_image)[0],
    ),  # now we are searching only among text vectors with our image query
    with_payload=[
        "caption"
    ],  # user-readable information about search results, we are interested to see which caption we will get
    limit=1,
)[0].payload["caption"]
```

```
'A photo of a cute pig'
```
