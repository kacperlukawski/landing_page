# Cheshire Cat

[Cheshire Cat](https://cheshirecat.ai/) is an open-source framework that allows you to develop intelligent agents on top of many Large Language Models (LLM). You can develop your custom AI architecture to assist you in a wide range of tasks.

Cheshire Cat uses Qdrant as the default [Vector Memory](https://cheshire-cat-ai.github.io/docs/conceptual/memory/vector_memory/) for ingesting and retrieving documents.
For more information check our articles about Vector Memory:
* [Donâ€™t get lost in Vector Space](https://cheshirecat.ai/dont-get-lost-in-vector-space/)
